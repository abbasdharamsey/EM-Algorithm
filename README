Abbas Dharamsey, Artificial Intelligece EM algorithm for noisy-OR

This was a task assigned in my Artifical Intelligence class for us to use the EM algorithm to estimate the noisy-OR parameters, pi, for the given dataset. As pi becomes more accurate, P(Y=1 | X) becomes more accurate and we get a more accurate log likelihood of the prediction.

All of the code is written in python. The test files are included, to run just have Python 2.7 installed and type 'python hw4.py' in the terminal. 

The homework file (hw4_wi15.pdf) has more information about the algorithms taking place in the code.
